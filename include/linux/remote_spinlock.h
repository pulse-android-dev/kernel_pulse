/* Grabbing a local spin lock before going for a remote lock has several
 * advantages:
 * 1. Get calls to preempt enable/disable and IRQ save/restore for free.
 * 2. For UP kernel, there is no overhead.
 * 3. Reduces the possibility of executing the remote spin lock code. This is
 *    especially useful when the remote CPUs' mutual exclusion instructions
 *    don't work with the local CPUs' instructions. In such cases, one has to
 *    use software based mutex algorithms (e.g. Lamport's bakery algorithm)
 *    which could get expensive when the no. of contending CPUs is high.
 * 4. In the case of software based mutex algorithm the exection time will be
 *    smaller since the no. of contending CPUs is reduced by having just one
 *    contender for all the local CPUs.
 * 5. Get most of the spin lock debug features for free.
 * 6. The code will continue to work "gracefully" even when the remote spin
 *    lock code is stubbed out for debug purposes or when there is no remote
 *    CPU in some board/machine types.
